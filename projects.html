            <h2> Consumer Pricing Index - Shoppers Drug Mart</h2>
            <p class="indent">In the Consumer Pricing Index project at Shoppers Drug Mart, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive solution aimed at accurately 
                averaging the consumer price of medicine in various locations. This initiative was pivotal for upper management, providing them with a nuanced understanding of 
                pricing dynamics within the geographical and pharmaceutical domain. Leveraging advanced statistical methodologies, we crafted a robust model capable of capturing 
                pricing variations across different categories of medication at the different pharmacies across Canada. One of the key features of our solution was its flexibility, allowing upper 
                management to access and interact with the model at varying levels of granularity. This granular view empowered decision-makers to delve 
                deeper into specific product segments or zoom out to analyze broader pricing trends, enabling them to make informed strategic decisions with 
                confidence. Through collaborative efforts and meticulous data analysis, we were able to streamline the process of price evaluation and optimization, 
                ensuring competitive pricing strategies aligned with market dynamics and customer demands.

            <h2> Real Estate Analytics - TMU</h2>
            <p class="indent">
            I was tasked with analyzing real estate metrics leveraging IBM's SPSS quantitative tool. This enabled me to gain valuable insights into market trends, property values, and investment opportunities. 
            By leveraging SPSS's user-friendly interface and robust statistical algorithms, I explored the dataset we were given for this project, identified influential factors such as location and amenities 
            on property prices, and conducted spatial analyses to uncover geographic patterns and hotspots of real estate activity. SPSS supports market segmentation and predictive modeling 
            techniques, enabling targeted marketing strategies, forecasting of future trends, and mitigating of risk. This project helped to develop my understanding of real estate markets and statistical analysis.

        <h2> Machine Learning Development - TMU</h2>
        <p class="indent">In the realm of Machine Learning Development, I was tasked with creating neural network designed for the identification of cancer cells. Given sample 
            data I embarked on the task of building a robust predictive model. Drawing upon state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and techniques, 
            I meticulously curated and preprocessed vast amounts of multidimensional data, including genetic markers and cellular attributes. Through iterative experimentation and rigorous 
            model refinement, we achieved remarkable accuracy in distinguishing malignant cells from benign ones, laying the groundwork for early detection and intervention 
            in cancer patients. Leveraging the power of deep learning, my model was able to distinguish the two types of cells using five inputs and three hidden layers. Each layer consisted
            of fifteen nodes.

            <h2> Retroactive Quantitative Analytics - Samsung</h2>
            <p class="indent"> Undertaking Retroactive Quantitative Analytics at Samsung, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of the price-performance dynamics within the realm of home 
                electronics. Delving into the vast collection of televisions and other consumer electronics, I meticulously analyzed historical data to discern intricate patterns and correlations. 
                By leveraging advanced statistical methodologies and predictive modeling techniques, I unearthed invaluable insights regarding future performance, quantity dynamics, and pricing 
                strategies. Armed with this actionable intelligence, Samsung was empowered to make data-driven decisions pertaining to inventory management, product positioning, and pricing optimization. 
                Our retrospective analysis not only shed light on past trends but also served as a guiding beacon for strategic foresight, enabling Samsung to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly 
                evolving market landscape. Additionally, during this process I was asked to present my findings to the head of the Home Electronics department at Samsung. This tested my ability to 
                perform under pressure and present my findings in a clear and concise manner.
