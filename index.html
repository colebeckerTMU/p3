        <p class="stext">Throughout my professional career, I have been responsible for the delivery of many initiatives
            that involved quantitative analysis. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the highlights:
        <ul class="listfix">
            <li class="listContent">At Samsung, I leveraged historical data to perform predictive analytics on the upcoming Q4 to determine product price and supply.</li>
            <li class="listContent">At Shoppers Drugmart, I combined a variety of data to create a consumer pricing index. This enabled management to efficiently
                look at price in a given location or region at various levels of granularity.</li>
            <li class="listContent">At Moneris, I leveraged market research and insider information to determine trends in the ecommerce
                space to prepare a report for the CEO at the time. </li>

            As I learn and develop as a professional, I look to combine my experience across all of my roles to create the most value in whichever
            present role I'm in.<br><br> Currently, I'm working towards adding automation into a traditional company that hasn't integrated a large amount 
            of information systems into their operations. Leveraging machine learning, Python, SQL, and a learned knowledge of APIs, I am helping to remove 
            mundane processes and free up those who were once doing these activities. I have three goals for this project:
            <ul>
                <li class="listContent"> Increase productivity for the organization. </li>
                <li class="listContent"> Increase overall work satisfaction </li> 
                <li class="listContent"> Develop my skills in the information systems consulting space.</li>

            I have been exposed to the idea of working for myself my entire life. This has not manifest itself in any particular way. However, it has enabled
            me to move through life with a unique lens on things I learn, work on, and develop. I like the idea of being able to develop my interests into 
            projects or products that have potential to be financially viable. Some of these ideas are listed below:
            <ul>
                <li class="listContent">Leveraging carpentry resources available to me to create items that align with my interests (Pool Cues / Table, Office Desk, Dining Table..etc)</li>
                <li class="listContent">Turning professional experience into products or services tailored to my industry.</li>
                <li class="listContent">Creating content with respect to the above, developing a personal / professional brand through this medium.</li>
